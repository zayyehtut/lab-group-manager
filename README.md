# Lab Group Manager - A Learning Project

## Project Overview

This Lab Group Manager is a learning project developed to explore and practice Next.js, React, and related technologies. It's designed as an educational tool to understand the process of building a mid-sized web application with modern frameworks and libraries.

**Note:** This project is not intended for professional use. It's a practice project created with the assistance of AI (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to test the capabilities of AI in guiding mid-sized project development.

## Project Goals

- Learn and implement Next.js 13+ with App Router
- Practice React and TypeScript in a real-world scenario
- Explore state management and data fetching in a Next.js environment
- Implement authentication and database operations using Supabase
- Gain experience with UI libraries like Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI

## Features

- User authentication (Students and Demonstrators)
- Student management (Add, Import via CSV, Search)
- Group management (Create, View, Add/Remove students)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Technology Stack

- Next.js 13+ (App Router)
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI
- Supabase (Authentication and Database)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install dependencies:
   cd lab-group-manager
   npm install

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your Supabase credentials:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

4. Run the development server:
   npm run dev

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Next.js App Router and server components
- React hooks and state management
- TypeScript for type-safe development
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Integrating third-party UI libraries (Shadcn UI)
- Authentication and database operations with Supabase
- CSV parsing and data import functionality
